# 🪻IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION – Iris Species Classification Using Machine Learning
This repository demonstrates a machine learning workflow for classifying iris species based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, Random Forest classification, model evaluation, and feature importance insights.

# 📇 Project Overview
    •Dataset: Iris dataset (Iris.csv) with SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm, and Species
    •Tools: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
    •Focus Areas: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Random Forest classification, model evaluation, ROC/AUC, confusion matrix, and feature importance

# ╰┈➤📝 Steps Breakdown
    •Step 1: Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handled duplicates, missing values, and dropped unnecessary columns.
    •Step 2: Performed EDA using histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, violin plots, and correlation heatmaps to understand feature distributions and relationships.
    •Step 3: Encoded target labels, split data into train/test sets, and trained a Random Forest classifier.
    •Step 4: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and multi-class ROC/AUC curves.
    •Step 5: Visualized feature importance to identify which measurements contributed most to species classification.

# 🎯 Outcome
Developed a Random Forest model achieving high accuracy in classifying Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Comprehensive EDA and visualizations provide insights into feature relevance and model behavior.
